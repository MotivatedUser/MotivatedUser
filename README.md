- 👋 Hi, I’m @MotivatedUser
- 👀 I’m interested in ... working as a Jr. FrontEnd Developer. I have a 1-2 years experience through various bootcamp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...FrontEnd Web Development @ Udemy. Just graduated from Nucamp Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp with honors.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'd love to get in on a couple of projects just for experience. One project I am currently working on is an App for Small Engine Shops(Something I had always wished for in my previous shop)... that will lead into another App geared at retail users. Both are intended to be subscription based with proceeds from parts as well. While at the same time providing great value, maximizing profits, keeping clients informed and helping to remove some of the day to day chaos of the industry.
